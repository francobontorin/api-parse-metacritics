Parsing Metacriticâ€™s
=====================

Introduction
------------

    This page documents the Python code parseMetacritics, which is intended to parse the Metacritics score from Playstation 3 and 4, Xbox 360 and One, PC, Nintendo Wii and others returning a formated JSON of the result.

    Another functionality is an exposed RESTAPI using Python requests module which allows a GET in /games/ to get all the scores and titles from Playstation 3 or a GET in /games/title_of_game that will bring the chosen game its score in a JSON output.

    All the documentation for this project was created using Python Sphinx; a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.
